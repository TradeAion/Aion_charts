/**
 * Custom series (plugin platform Phase C-c) — Aion's take on lightweight-charts v5's
 * `addCustomSeries`/`ICustomSeriesPaneView` (LWC api/chart-api.ts, model/icustom-series.ts).
 *
 * A custom series is a user-defined series TYPE: the engine owns its time mapping (its data
 * rows carry times only, so the merged time scale, logical ranges, and coordinate math work
 * exactly like built-ins) while the plugin owns the item shape and the per-bar drawing. Like
 * the primitives (see `primitives.ts`), drawing never touches a canvas: the plugin's
 * {@link custom_series_pane_view.render} records backend-neutral draw commands through the
 * context below, and the host folds them into the pane's `main` layer **at the series' own
 * paint-order position** — a custom series z-orders between built-in series exactly like a
 * built-in kind, and its output is pixel-identical on the WebGPU and Canvas2D backends.
 *
 * Data flow mirrors LWC: `series.set_data(items)` / `series.update(item)` take the raw plugin
 * items (ascending unique times required — out-of-order input is stably sorted and duplicates
 * collapse last-wins, the same repair the built-ins get); `series.data()` returns the aligned
 * raw items. Item `time` values go through the same UTC-seconds conversion as built-in data.
